*In this chapter...* we introduce what calculus is and make a few remarks about the nature of these notes.

# What Is Calculus?

Calculus is the study of changing quantities, and how they are related. Modern calculus was pioneered by scientists like Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, who sought to describe various aspects of the natural world in mathematical terms. Today, calculus serves a foundational role in science and engineering, not to mention statistics and probability. This makes calculus an invaluable tool for modeling and solving numerical problems.

These notes are split into two halves. The first half discusses differential calculus, which is concerned with rates of change. You're probably familiar with slope, and how it can be used to describe linear relationships (such as time and distance traveled). Differential calculus introduces the notion of the *derivative*, which essentially gives the rate of change of a function at every point.

The derivative of a function tells us a lot about its properties, such as the domains where it is increasing and decreasing. This information can be used to identify the points where the function attains its maximum or minimum value. The practice of finding these points&mdash;optimization&mdash;has many applications in problem solving. Furthermore, many physical laws are expressed using differential equations, which are the language of differential calculus.

Then we have integral calculus, which is just differential calculus in reverse. Suppose you have some function that describes the rate of change of a quantity; what's the value of the quantity itself? Integral calculus focuses on the accumulation of change. For this reason, the act of integration is often described as finding the area under a curve.

Integrals have many applications. A wide range of problems involving volume and surface area can be expressed in terms of integration. In addition, they are invaluable for determining the behavior of systems governed by differential equations.

# About These Notes

These notes are not meant to be a rigorous treatment of calculus; we're not going to be constructing the real numbers or any of that fun stuff.
 Instead, this resource is merely meant to explain various calculus concepts in a digestible way. That's why there are also no practice problems. If you crave rigor, you should check out Michael Spivak's *Calculus* or Tom M. Apostol's *Calculus*.

Each chapter is designed to be mostly self contained. If you are familiar with the preceding concepts, feel free to skip ahead to whatever you want to learn about.
