I hate being treated like a weirdo when I have to explain my quirks to someone.

I hate asking for help and being told to just do *X*, and struggling to explain that I can't "just" do *X* because... because why? "Because I just can't"? Yeah, right&mdash;no one's going to believe that. Some exuse.

I hate not being able to hone my talents because I can't stay on one thing long enough to get good at it.

I hate the sinking feeling that I get when I see my grades slowly sliding downhill because I couldn't get my work done on time.

I hate obsessing about something to the point where it practically hurts for me to think about it, only for me to feel utterly disinterested a few days later.

I hate when I forget what I was thinking about, because the thought that disappeared always feels like the most important thing in the world.

I hate that I can't get the help I need because I can't even get myself to make a phone call.

I hate annoying everyone around me and breaking everything I get my hands on because I can't stop fidgeting.

I hate trying to have a conversation with someone only to end up talking about myself and driving them away. 

I hate procrastinating on all of my responsibilities until the last moment, where I either kill myself trying to do everything in way too little time or risk having to sheepishly explain why I chose to waste all the more-than-ample time that I was given to complete my work.

I hate being reminded that I could accomplish so much more if only I had more control over my life.

I hate lying awake every night, staring at the ceiling while I remember all the stupid things I've done and said and how badly I've fucked up every decision that I've ever made.

I hate not being able to try new things or express myself creatively because any negative criticism makes me crawl right back into my cave.

I hate that my friends and loved ones know not to trust me with any responsibilities because I've flaked on them so many times.

I hate inevitably losing everything that is mine, no matter how important it is.

I hate a million other little things that I don't even know how to put to words.

I hate that apparently this is who I'm supposed to be.
