Like, what if my own mother were to die tomorrow? Would I feel anything at all? Would I even cry?</p>
<p>Time and time again, I put myself in that imaginary situation, only for nothing to happen. No tears, no pit in my stomach, no insurmountable despair. Nothing. It&#39;s starting to get really creepy, to be honest. I mean, what the hell&#39;s wrong with me? Am I a sociopath or something? The only sane explanation I can think of is that maybe they&#39;re lacing my food with antidepressants at the dining hall, because I really, really don&#39;t want this to be who I am.</p>
<p>Whenever that happens, I invariably turn to dredging up memories where I might have felt something to prove myself wrong. Like when my first cat died. It was a long and drawn out process. When the time finally came, I remembered feeling a lot, but mostly anger at my parents for letting her succumb to such a slow, painful illness. And then, I cried. (Gee, what a fuckin&#39; surprise!) But not long after, it&#39;s almost as if I stopped caring&mdash;out of sight, out of mind. Even back then, it felt like it all happened far too quickly. I remember wondering if I had even loved her at all. I kept trying to convince myself that that wasn&#39;t the case. I mean, I did all the things that someone who loves a cat might do; when she first came to our doorstep as a stray cat, I remember badgering my parents day and night to let us keep her. I&#39;d snuggle up with her and play with her and hold her close, but what&#39;s it all worth if you don&#39;t have some sadness to show for it?</p>
<p>The next time something like that happens, I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;d be able to fake tears.</p>
<p>The most alarming part is that I feel like my illness has only progressed with time. I&#39;ve been subjecting myself to this little exercise since forever, but at least in the past, I could reassure myself by recalling moments of genuine emotion. I would give anything to be plunged back into one of my wintry bouts of depression, where I felt so crushed that I could not even bear to go on living, or to relive September 21st and to hear again those words that ripped my sinewy heart into a million tender shreds. Anything to escape the horrifying silence, to wake me up from this nightmare and prove that it was all a dream, that I am a normal person replete with capacity for happiness and grief and not some awful soulless machine.</p>
<p>Then, I wonder how it got to be this bad. Was I born like this, or was it the product of some horrible mistake in my upbringing? Maybe the work of privilege? Affluenza? Psychopathy? All possibilities, but deep down, I know that I am the one who is responsible for destroying any chance of redemption with my acidic tears of deceitful empathy and counterfeit compassion. I had the chance to at least be transparent regarding my vile spiritual disfigurement, and instead, I chose to don the costume of the sheep as I reached to draw them in with my disgusting tendrils of depravity. Now I am doomed to drown upon my own purulent secretions, stained green with envy and perfumed by the putrid notes of cowardice, yet still I find the nerve to pen this desperate piece of performative self-flagellation in a final act of unabashed selfishness. </p>
<p>So I sit here, writing this as I am overcome by a profound, monstrous emptiness. The gross remains of my decayed heart weakly quiver in fear of the ceaseless oblivion that certainly awaits such a diseased soul, but that too turns to apathy as I stare into an unending chasm of indifference and wish that it would just swallow me whole into its tepid blackness already.</p>
