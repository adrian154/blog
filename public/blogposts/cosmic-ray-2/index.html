If you haven&#39;t seen that one yet, I highly recommend checking it out, and I&#39;m not just saying that because I wrote it ;)</p>
<p>Like millions of other Americans, I headed out to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas">middle of nowhere</a> a few weeks ago to witness a total eclipse of the Sun&mdash;but I also used that opportunity to hunt down another interesting astronomical phenomenon! Since I made the trip by plane, I thought that it would be cool to observe increased cosmic ray flux in the upper atmosphere, which was how they were initially determined to be of extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have any devices designed for the measurement of ionizing radiation, but I do have a camera that can take pictures automatically. It turns out that charged particles are quite capable of activating the pixels in any camera&#39;s sensor, allowing one to be used as a crude particle detector. So, before I boarded my flight, I set my camera to record one 60-second exposure after another, leaving me with 320 images spanning from takeoff to landing.</p>
<p>But enough talk, here&#39;s the data:</p>

<p>I was honestly surprised to see that the experiment had actually worked, but it&#39;s pretty hard to argue with that trend! The huge spike was probably caused by this particle, which left quite an impressive track:</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re not happy with just one dose of radiation, I also made my phone record its journey through the airport&#39;s X-ray machine.</p>
