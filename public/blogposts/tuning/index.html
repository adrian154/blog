Wait, what?</p>
<p>Okay, that&#39;s not quite true. You <em>can</em> tune a piano, but only approximately. It turns out that the mathematics behind the 12-tone scale used in most Western music hides some sinister secrets.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the basics. Behind every key on a piano are 1&ndash;3 strings, which have been tensioned so that when the strings are struck they will ring out at a specific frequency. Each note is associated with a distinct frequency, and keys are arranged such that the pitch of the notes increases from left to right.</p>
<p>Of course, the burning question remains: how do we know what frequency to assign to each note? The answer to this is pretty nuanced, but luckily we get one freebie. Every tuning system starts by assigning a specific frequency to an arbitrary key to use as a reference point; we call this the pitch standard. The most common pitch standard in modern times is A440, which sets the frequency of the first A above middle C to 440 Hz.</p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s do a little experiment. This is what it sounds like if I play A<sub>4</sub> on my piano.</p>

<p>Ironically, my piano is pretty badly out of tune, but that doesn&#39;t matter for this demonstration. I can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">a bit of math</a> to take the sound and dissect it into the individual frequencies that make it up, kind of like how a prism can split light into its color components. Here is the resulting spectrum:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big peak representing the main frequency, but there are also a bunch of extra peaks, which are known as overtones or partials. The reason for their production has to do with the physics of string vibration. Essentially, a string that is fixed at both ends is limited to vibrating at integer multiples of its fundamental frequency; these patterns of vibration are called <em>resonant modes</em>. Together, these modes form the harmonic series.</p>
<p>When a string is struck or plucked, the resulting vibration contains multiple of these resonant modes, creating a complex spectrum like the one that we observed. The same phenomenon is actualy exhibited by many other oscillating systems besides strings. For example, air in a tube is also confined to resonating at multiples of the tube&#39;s fundamental frequency. This is why, for a given fingering, a French horn player is restricted to playing notes within the harmonic series. </p>
