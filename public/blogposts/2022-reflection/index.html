So I thought I&#39;d take a moment to reflect on what a year it&#39;s been. Some highlights that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started a blog and proceeded to write over 45,000 words about my miscellaneous tinkerings. People seemed to really like it! I&#39;ve received dozens of questions and comments from total strangers, and had many interesting conversations.</li>
<li>I spent a lot of time coding, racking up over 1,200 commits.</li>
<li>I went to DEF CON with friends.</li>
<li>I found love!! &lt;3</li>
<li>I compromised the digital ID app that my school adopted and met with the company&#39;s CEO.</li>
<li>I started speedsolving Rubik&#39;s cubes as a hobby. (Just yesterday, I set a new personal record of 18.85 seconds!)</li>
<li>I applied to college. It was a long, grueling process.</li>
<li>I grew my hair out.</li>
<li>I talked on Discord. Maybe too much.</li>
<li>I tweeted like there was no tomorrow.</li>
<li>I tended to my garden, which provided me with bountiful harvests of hot peppers and beans.</li>
<li>My cat gave birth to five healthy kittens!</li>
<li>I took a lot of photos. Some good&hellip; most bad. You can check out the ones that made the cut on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/192931620@N06/">Flickr</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was an eventful year, to say the least. For every moment of peace and tranquility, there were times of fear and doubt, and there was certainly no shortage of things to worry about. Yet in the end, I made it through.</p>
<h1 id="upcoming-blogposts">Upcoming Blogposts <a class="section-link" href="#upcoming-blogposts">&sect;</a></h1><p>If you&#39;re disappointed that this isn&#39;t a technical blogpost, don&#39;t worry&mdash;there are several of those in the pipeline! Here&#39;s a summary of what&#39;s in the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Explained</li>
<li>ExFAT Driver in Assembly</li>
<li>IP over Audio Jack</li>
<li>JPEG, Explained</li>
<li>Minecraft Mob Spawning</li>
<li>Analyzing Internet Background Noise</li>
<li>Optimally Solving Rubik&#39;s Cube</li>
<li>Minecraft Server Census 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve been in a bit of a rut recently when it comes to writing, but progress is still being made; I&#39;ll probably finish at least one of these by January. So buckle up and sit tight. We&#39;ll return to our regularly scheduled programming shortly.</p>
<p>Oh, and if your name happens to be 2023, you&#39;d better watch out. Because we&#39;re more ready than ever to kick your ass.</p>

Until next time,<br>
