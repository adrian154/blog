As I write this blogpost, 2022 will meet its demise in the span of just three days. So I thought I'd take a moment to reflect on what a year it's been. Some highlights that come to mind:

<div class="highlights">
    <div class="left">
        <div><span>I started a blog and proceeded to write over 45,000 words about my miscellaneous tinkerings. People seemed to really like it!</span></div>

    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <div><span>I applied to college. It was a long, grueling process.</span></div>

    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <img src="hair.png">
        <div><span>I grew my hair out.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <div><span>I talked on Discord. Maybe too much.</span></div>

    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <img src="twitter.png">
        <div><span>I tweeted like there was no tomorrow.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <div><span>I tended to my garden, which rewarded me with bountiful harvests of tomatoes and hot peppers.</span></div>
        <img src="tomato.png">
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <img src="kittens.png">
        <div><span>My cat gave birth to a litter of five healthy kittens!</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <div><span>I took a lot of photos. Some good&hellip; most bad. You can check out the ones that made the cut on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/192931620@N06/">Flickr</a>.</span></div>
        <img src="photos.png">
    </div>

It was an eventful year, to say the least. For every moment of peace and tranquility, there were times of fear and doubt, and there was certainly no shortage of things to worry about. Yet in the end, I made it through.

# Upcoming Blogposts

If you're disappointed that this isn't a technical blogpost, don't worry&mdash;there are several of those in the pipeline! Here's a summary of what's in the works:

- Bitcoin Explained
- ExFAT Driver in Assembly
- IP over Audio Jack
- JPEG, Explained
- Minecraft Mob Spawning
- Analyzing Internet Background Noise
- Optimally Solving Rubik's Cube
- Minecraft Server Census 2.0

I've been in a bit of a rut recently when it comes to writing, but progress is still being made. The goal that I've set for myself is to finish at least one of these by the end of January. So buckle up and sit tight; we'll return to our regularly scheduled programming shortly.

Oh, and if your name happens to be 2023, you'd better watch out. Because we're more ready than ever to kick your ass.
