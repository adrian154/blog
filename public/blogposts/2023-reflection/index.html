<p>2023 has finally come to an end. So, I guess it&#39;s time to reflect on what a strange time these last twelve months have been.</p>

<p>This might be the part where I whine about my various misgivings about this past year, but I figure that the time has come to set them aside before they are committed to the historical record. So I&#39;m just going to say that I still think I got a lot out of this year. I met a lot of friends, made a number of cherished memories, and discovered a lot of new interests that I would have never anticipated. And really, isn&#39;t that what it&#39;s all about?</p>
<h1 id="upcoming-blogposts">Upcoming Blogposts <a class="section-link" href="#upcoming-blogposts">&sect;</a></h1><p>In writing this blogpost, I ended up referencing last year&#39;s reflection, and <em>wow</em>&mdash;I didn&#39;t do very well on my goal of finishing all the incomplete posts I listed. Oops. Here&#39;s the status update on a couple of those:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Explained: dropped for lack of interest.</li>
<li>ExFAT Driver in Assembly: dropped because writing real mode assembly is pretty painful.</li>
<li>IP over Audio Jack: I wrote a brand new implementation using WebAudio, which was quite fun! Unfortunately the receiver has some problems, and I can&#39;t really test the program without two devices, so I probably won&#39;t be able to work on it for some time. But still&hellip; progress! I really want to finish this eventually.</li>
<li>Analyzing Internet Background Noise: still on my TODO list, but low priority. </li>
<li>Optimally Solving Rubik&#39;s Cube: I will write this one when I figure out how to actually do it. </li>
<li>Minecraft Server Census 2.0: I <em>did</em> end up writing a new scanner and re-mapping IPv4 space, but the results were not really different enough to warrant a new post. So, I guess I kind of completed this one? I dunno.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way, I did end up getting a lot of new blogpost ideas, some of which I am currently working on. Time has been hard to come by ever since starting college, but I still think that blogging is just a great way to share cool stuff and I want to keep doing it.</p>
<p>So.. stay tuned. Because there&#39;s always more to come :-)</p>
<p style="text-align: right">
Until next time,<br>
