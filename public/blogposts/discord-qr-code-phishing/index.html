This has given rise to new versions of familiar old attacks with terrible names like &quot;quishing&quot;. Today, we&#39;re going to be looking at how scammers are exploiting Discord&#39;s QR code login feature.</p>
<p>It all starts with a message like this from a friend.</p>
<p><img src="initial.png" alt="initial message"></p>
<p>So you join the server, and you&#39;re greeted with a request for verification:</p>
<p><img src="verification.png" alt="verification prompt with qr code"></p>
<p>Once you scan the code, that&#39;s it&mdash;you&#39;ve handed total access of your account to whoever generated the sign-in link.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-works">How It Works <a class="section-link" href="#how-it-works">&sect;</a></h1><p>If you haven&#39;t logged into Discord recently, here&#39;s what you are greeted with when you are not signed in to the app.</p>
<p><img src="signin-example.png" alt="signin screen"></p>
<p>Here&#39;s what the intended usage looks like: you scan the QR code on your phone (where you&#39;re already signed into Discord); this launches the app, which then prompts you whether you want to log in.</p>
<img style="max-width: 300px" src="phone-prompt.png" alt="phone prompt screen">

<p>If you tap &quot;Yes, log me in&quot;, this triggers an authenticated request to Discord&#39;s servers, which then signs you in wherever the QR code was first generated. As you can see, this system is ripe for abuse when combined with a little bit of social engineering. If you are unlucky enough to sign in without heeding Discord&#39;s warning, this is what you&#39;re greeted with:</p>
<p><img src="verified.png" alt="verified"></p>
<p>And soon afterwards&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="pwned.png" alt="pwned"></p>
<p>&hellip;you become one with the horde.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How To Protect Yourself <a class="section-link" href="#how-to-protect-yourself">&sect;</a></h1><p>It&#39;s entirely up to you to stay safe against these types of attacks; the possibility of someone abusing this mechanism to gain access to your account is, unfortunately, <strong>intended functionality</strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily, the steps you need to take are simple. Simply avoid ever scanning an unfamiliar QR code in the Discord app; I would frankly recommend completely avoiding this method of sign-in.</p>
<p>Sharing your QR code should not make you vulnerable as the QR codes do not appear to be associated with any user accounts&mdash;after all, they&#39;re generated <em>before</em> you&#39;ve signed in. Still, I would err on the side of caution and not do that.</p>
