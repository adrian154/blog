(2/2)</h1><p><strong>Hey!</strong> If you haven&#39;t yet, consider reading the <a href="internet-part-1.html">prequel</a> to this blogpost.</p>
<p>Last time, we dove deep into the inner workings of the Internet, examining how IP packets get from point A to point B. Today, we&#39;re going to see how Internet access powers the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Web is a collection of information and applications, websites, that are accessible via URLs. (You&#39;re on one right know.) Let&#39;s see what makes it tick.</p>
<h2 id="shortcomings-of-ip">Shortcomings of IP <a class="section-link" href="#shortcomings-of-ip">&sect;</a></h2><p>The Internet Protocol is great, but it isn&#39;t perfect. It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort delivery</a>, meaning that intermediate routers will <em>try</em> to get your message to its destination, but if it gets lost on the way... don&#39;t come calling. Packet loss isn&#39;t a rare event, too; it&#39;s relatively uncommon, but just one dropped packet can severely disrupt the function of an application. Imagine downloading a large file, only to find out that it&#39;s unusuable because one part of it was dropped in transit. Furthermore, because IP is stateless (and two packets could take totally different routes), there&#39;s no guarantee that the packets which <em>do</em> make it are in the correct order, or that their contents haven&#39;t been corrupted. Clearly, we need another layer on top of IP to gracefully handle all of these conditions.</p>
<h1 id="transmission-control-protocol">Transmission Control Protocol <a class="section-link" href="#transmission-control-protocol">&sect;</a></h1><p>IP&#39;s unreliable nature is fairly unfriendly to most applications, so several transport-layer protocols were created to abstract away the details of IP, of which the <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (TCP) holds the distinction of being one of the oldest and most widespread. </p>
<p>TCP offers <em>guaranteed delivery</em>, in contrast to IP&#39;s best-effort delivery. Packets will always be consumed in the order they were sent. If a packet is corrupted or dropped, retransmission will be attempted, and if guaranteed delivery isn&#39;t possible, the connection will enter an error state instead of silently failing. In addition, TCP hides all the details of packet fragmentation and reassembly, instead presenting the network as a set of readable and writeable byte streams to applications. </p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts <a class="section-link" href="#basic-concepts">&sect;</a></h2><p>Every packet in TCP has a <em>sequence number</em>, which is used to organize packets in the event that they are received out of order. </p>
<h1 id="grabbing-hypertext">Grabbing Hypertext <a class="section-link" href="#grabbing-hypertext">&sect;</a></h1><h1 id="what-the-heck-are-domains">What the Heck Are Domains? <a class="section-link" href="#what-the-heck-are-domains">&sect;</a></h1><p>When you typed <code>blog.bithole.dev</code> into your browser, it sent a request to 142.93.26.121, which replied with this blogpost. But how did it know where to send the request? The answer is the <strong>domain name system</strong>, or DNS. Let&#39;s see how it works.</p>
<p>Back in the days of ARPANET, there was no DNS. Instead, there was one server, the Host Naming Registry (maintained by <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/elizabeth-feinler">Elizabeth Feinler</a>), which was responsible for resolving domains into IPs for the entire network.</p>
