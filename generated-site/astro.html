I had the opportunity to use a rather nice <a href="https://www.tamron.jp/en/product/lenses/f017.html">90mm macro lens</a> by Tamron, and since it&#39;s got a longer focal length than anything else I own (besides the 300mm zoom lens, which my puny tracker can&#39;t handle anyways) as well as fairly wide aperture, I decided to see what kind of images it could produce.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my technique is by far the limiting step throughout all of this. The whole experience was hindered by my relative inexperience:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not very good at achieving a good focus, so the stars are a little blobby right off the bat. (I should really get around to making or buying a focusing mask.)</li>
<li>I calibrated the image using the usual trifecta (dark, flat, and bias). However, putting the lens cap on to take the dark frames caused it to immediately fog up; not a problem, but evidently it screwed up my light frame since there&#39;s a dark spot in the middle of the image caused by a mote of dust. I&#39;m not 100% sure if it was the fog that did it, or whether I even applied the light frames while stacking, but oh well.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t have an external intervalometer, so I am limited to my camera&#39;s built-in maximum of 30-second exposures. Not that I have  much of a choice, since I&#39;m not very good at polar alignment either, so pushing my subs past 30 seconds would probably introduce ridiculous tracking error.</li>
</ul>
<p>But enough self-deprecation, here&#39;s the gory details.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gear</strong><ul>
<li>iOptron Skyguider Pro</li>
<li>Nikon D7000</li>
<li>Tamron 90mm macro lens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capture</strong><ul>
<li>120 light frames, 30 second exposure time, f/3.5 at ISO 200</li>
<li>dark, flat, and bias frames</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Processing</strong><ul>
<li>Stacked in DeepSkyStacker</li>
<li>Stretched in Photoshop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the final result...</p>

<p>OK, not much to look at, because that&#39;s before any post-processing in Photoshop. Here&#39;s the final result, after much fiddling with sliders and cropping.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually pretty proud of this result. It&#39;s probably my best astrophoto. (Hardly impressive, but we all start somewhere.) That being said, there are a couple issues that irk me a ltitle:</p>
<ul>
<li>The core is rather bright and dangerously close to clipping.</li>
<li>The star coloring is a little odd, though as I write this blogpost I&#39;ve gotten much more used to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve been rather interested in examining how my <a href="http://www.markshelley.co.uk/Astronomy/Processing/ACR_Critique/acr_critique.html">processing workflow</a> may be mangling the colors in my images, so here are the results of my own tinkerings. First, I reprocessed my stacked data from that outing, this time making sure to only apply adjustments to all channels instead of manually balancing the color until it looks good. Here&#39;s a comparison shot.</p>

<p>Yes, the one on the right is a little washed out and the noise is especially apparent, but that&#39;s not important for what I am investigating. I proceeded to pick the color from a specific location in both images. The values I got were (6501, 5248, 6222) and (27740, 26994, 27590). Now, in theory, the ratio between these values should be the same, but they&#39;re not. Clearly, if preserving the original colors of your image is important to you, you cannot rely on Photoshop&#39;s levels/curves adjustments.</p>
