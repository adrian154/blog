<p>When you typed <code>blog.bithole.dev</code> into your browser, it sent a request to 142.93.26.121, which replied with this blogpost. But how did it know where to send the request? The answer is the <strong>domain name system</strong>, or DNS. Let&#39;s see how it works.</p>
<p>Back in the days of ARPANET, there was no DNS. Instead, there was one server, the Host Naming Registry (maintained by <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/elizabeth-feinler">Elizabeth Feinler</a>), which was responsible for resolving domains into IPs for the entire network. This worked fine for some time, but it quickly became apparent that as the nascent Internet grew, a system which scaled beyond a single server would be necessary. And thus, the present incarnation of the domain name system was born.</p>
