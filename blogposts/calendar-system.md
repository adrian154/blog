Calendar system. Okay.

How did people tell time back in the day? Astronomical phenomenon. Rotation of Earth is the day. Revolution of the Earth is the year. Lunar phases had something to do with the month.

Why should our calendar aim to correspond to astronomical phenomena?

It affects our lives. Human circadian rhythm matches day/night. So much stuff revolves around the seasons.

What's wrong with the current calendar?

It tries to match two *unrelated* processes together. There are *not* 365 days in a year, so you need leap years. Also, how come every month has different numbers of days? What the heck?

Also, annoying that solstices are seemingly random dates. Why does the year start when it does? 
* Does time between solstices change?

Also not keen on the whole Christ thing, and the lack of a zero year. Want zero year to be one with some astronomical significance.

Problem: only familiar with Gregorian calendar. 365 days is a reasonable approximation but 12 months is totally arbitrary. Like 12 though; factor of 4 and 3. But 10 maybe better.

Need to research calendar systems in other cultures. What the hell were the Mayans doing?

So many problems. Does day length change? Oh my god. The fucking mantle is causing the day length to fluctuate. That's really annoying.
* Choose to ignore.

List of priorities:

* Days must be clearly demarcated; any deviation is immediately apparent
* Years shouldn't drift either, ideally grounded to solstices 
* Lunar cycle/tides, but I don't think we can meet all three conditions. Too many moving parts. All so imprecise.

What the hell is a week?
* Think it's organizational and not structural. Not bound to any phenomena. Current weekend scheme is bad. Another problem to address, too bad this one is social.

Idea for an analogy. Currently we treat days and years like hands on a clock. But in reality the situation is more like both of the hands are spinning at slightly varying rates and definitely not in sync.

What to do with months? 
* Get rid of months. Subdivide year into 4 segments for 4 seasons

Two relevant things:
* Analemma
* Solarigraphy

Okay. First need to figure out how we can do our own observations.

More relevant astronomical things.
* Equatorial ring
