## Electrostatic Force

* Conservative, like gravity
    * similar to gravity
        * charge <-> mass
    * force: $$F = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$$
    * $k$ is a constant: $$k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$ 
        * $\epsilon_0$ is vacuum permitivity
    * work is equal to potential difference regardless of path
    * field strength: $$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}$$
    * electric potential from a point: $$V = \frac{kQ}{r}$$
        * voltage is difference in potential
* Diagrams of electric fields
    * field line: path that a positive particle would follow 
    * equipotential lines are lines where the potential is the same
* Parallel charged plates
    * charge between plates is uniform
    * moving positive charge: positive change in potential = negative work
    * moving negative charge: positive change in potential = positive work

**Capacitors**
* Parallel metal plates
    * As potential builds up in one side, opposite charge builds up in other side
    * As charges build up it becomes harder to add more charge
    * capacitance is the ratio of charge on the plates and the potential diference: $$c = \frac{Q}v$$
    * capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor in vacuum: $$c = \frac{\epsilon_0A}{d}$$
        * $A$ is the area, $d$ is the separation
    * energy stored in a capacitor: $E = \frac12 cV^2$

## Magnetism

$$F = BQv\sin\theta$$

$$F = BI\ell\sin\theta$$

Right hand rules:
* fingers point in direction of magnetic field, thumb points in direction of charge movement, open palm = magnetic force
* grab wire, thumb points in velocity of charge, finger curl = direction of magnetic field

field strength at distance from wire:

$$B = \frac{\mu I}{2\pi r}$$
* $\mu$ is permeability

$$\text{emf} = B\ell v$$

curved mirrors:
$$\frac1f = \frac1S_o + \frac1S_i$$

$$m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{-S_i}{S_o}$$
