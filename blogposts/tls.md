The Internet is, by default, not secure. In TCP and below, everything is transferred in plaintext, meaning an attacker could read your communications or masquerade as the person you *think* you're talking with in order to steal your credentials or gain access to privileged systems. Yet today, most individuals will never fall prey to such man-in-the-middle attacks. What changed? The answer is the **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol, which transparently secures much of the modern-day web. How does it pull off this seemingly impossible feat? Let's find out.

# Conceptual Overview

TLS solves two cryptographic problems: **confidentiality**, **authentication**, and **integrity**. All three properties are necessary for most applications requiring a secure channel of communication, but each one has a distinct meaning. 

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is simple enough; you don't want a third party to be able to read your communications, because that would obviously compromise your security. Nobody wants their passwords and private information broadcast for the whole Internet to see. The solution is to encrypt your data with a cipher, an algorithm which accepts a plaintext and a key and produces a ciphertext, such that it is only feasible to retrieve the plaintext if you have the key. When a cipher uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, it is called a [symmetric cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm).

Symmetric ciphers are preferred for the bulk encryption of data because they are much faster than their asymmetric counterparts, but they have one fatal flaw: key exchange. The two communicating parties need to figure out a way to share a single key in order to read each other's messages, but this creates a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation: how do you transmit the key if the channel isn't secure? This is one of the fundamental problems in cryptography, and it is known as **key exchange**.

Today, the most widely used key exchange method (which is also preferred by TLS) is a scheme called [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange). It enables a client and a server to generate the same secret value while only exchanging publicly knowable data.

![DHKE diagram using paint analogy](static/images/DHKE-paint-analogy.png)

<br>

Ultimately, what makes this scheme secure is that separating the paints is infeasible for an attacker. We can make this model a little more rigorous by replacing the paints with numerical values. Suppose `C` is some common value that both Alice and Bob know. The paint-combining function can be modeled as a function `F`, with the following properties:
* It is easy to compute `F(x, y)`, but very difficult to retrieve `x` and `y` given the output of the function. (Examples of such functions will be discussed later).
* `F` is associative, i.e. `F(x, F(y, z)) = F(y, F(x, z))`.

Now, we're ready to do the key exchange. Alice generates a random secret `A`, and Bob generates a random secret `B`. Alice sends Bob `F(A, C)` and Bob sends Alice `F(B, C)`. Now, both can compute the value of `F(A, F(B, C))` and `F(B, F(A, C))`, respectively. Because `F` is associative, Alice and Bob arrive at the same value, which they can now use as the key to a symmetric cipher. However, an attacker who knows the common value and the values sent over the network still doesn't have enough information to calculate the secret. The attacker needs to know either `A` or `B` to calculate the secret, but because it is difficult to reverse `F`, the attacker is unable to retrieve the secret values and can't determine the shared secret.

<div class="info-box">

The function `F` is my simplified way of explaining operations over elements of an [algebraic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)), which comes with the guarantee that the operations will be associative. For example, [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) uses a [multiplicative group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n) where the modulus is a large semiprime; its security is derived from the difficulty of [integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization). Today, cryptosystems based on [elliptic curve groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) have become popular since they offer similar security to RSA with much smaller and thus more convenient keys. They are based on the difficulty of finding the discrete logarithm of an elliptic curve point.

## Authentication

Confidentiality is worthless if you can't ensure that the person on the other end of the line is who you actually *intend* to talk to. One of TLS's central goals is to prevent impersonation by enabling clients to securely verify the identity of the remote server, a process known as **authentication**. It accomplishes this with the help of digital signatures.

To create a digital signature, you need to first create a keypair. The details of this process depend on which digital signature algorithm you're using. Once you've got a keypair, you can use the signing algorithm to create a digital signature from the data which you want to sign and your private key. Then, anyone can use the verification algorithm to confirm that *you* (or whoever has your private keys) created that signature by providing it the signature, the data, and your public key. This way, only you can create valid signatures, but anyone can prove their validity.

One can imagine a scheme involving a trusted third party that leverages the power of digital signatures to perform authentication. If Bob wanted to prove his identity to Alice, he could combine his public key and name into a *certificate*, and then get Carol to sign it. Carol is a very well-trusted member of society, so everyone already knows her public key. Now, to prove his identity to anyone, Bob can simply present his certificate signed by Carol, and prove that he controls the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate by creating a valid signature with it. Essentially, this method establishes a chain of trust back to Carol.

![chain of trust diagram](static/images/certificate-chain-of-trust.png)

*A rough diagram showing how a verifiable chain of trust is created using digital signatures. [Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chain_Of_Trust.svg) by Yukhih / [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)*

This is essentially how TLS performs authentication. The trusted organization which signs certificates is known as a [certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), and instead of including human names, most certificates contain the bearer's domain name. If you're on Chrome, you can click the padlock icon next to the URL of this page to view the SSL certificate of the webserver running this blog. Here's what you might expect to see:

![picture of the ssl cert for this site](static/images/windows-cert-view.png)

This shows the chain of trust that your browser followed to verify that the server it was talking to actually represented `blog.bithole.dev`. During the TLS handshake process, all three of these certificates were sent from my server to your browser. The first certificate named `bithole.dev` contains my server's public key, as well as a signature that your browser can use to validate my certificate by looking at `R3`'s public key. In turn, `R3` is signed by `ISRG Root X1`, whose fingerprint is hardcoded into your browser as one of several trusted **root certificates**. By presenting this chain of certificates and then showing that it has ownership over the private keys for the identifying certificate (`bithole.dev`), my webserver was able to prove its identity to your browser.

# C â†’ S: Client Hello

TLS handshakes begin with the Client Hello message, where the client declares its capabilities to the server. Most importantly, it lists the TLS versions it understands as well as a list of supported ciphers for encryption.

# S â†’ C: Change Cipher Spec

Next, the server sends the Change Cipher Spec message. This isn't used in TLS 1.3, but to avoid confusing intermediate nodes, this message is still sent. From this point on, the rest of the handshake is encrypted.

# Behind the Scenes 

Making the interactive TLS session was a bizarre experience that turned out to be surprisingly treacherous. It turns out, I have a penchant for doing things the wrong way. In this case, it involved modifying OpenSSL to log the private keys used in the handshake key exchange process and rebuilding NodeJS from source. Here's the patch I applied before rebuilding:

You can download the full packet capture of the exchange which this page is based on [here](static/tls-capture.pcap). You'll also need the [keylog](static/tls-keylog.txt) to decrypt the capture. Alternatively, you can make your own using the [code](https://gist.github.com/adrian154/5dd6a3231d49f3783688b176afd025e7).
